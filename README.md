Purpose of this Project:

Created an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. The client wanted to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, along with the data on a third map. It is an interactive webpage map with data in real time calling and use API keys.
