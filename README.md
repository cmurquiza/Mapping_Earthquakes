# Purpose of this Project:

Created an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. The client wanted to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, along with the data on a third map. It is an interactive webpage map with data in real time calling and use API keys.
